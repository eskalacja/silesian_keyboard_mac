This software is made by Szymon Nowicki with Ukulele app.

You can use it any way you like, even for commercial purposes.
However, you CAN NOT sell it to anyone as a single product. You CAN sell it as a part of software.

It would be nice if you send me an email with usage information. You'll find my contact details on my website. 

*****************************
What is it anyway?
*****************************

This is Silesian keyboard layout made for Mac OS X as a copy of other platforms versions which you can find on puslunsku.eu website.

There was no file for my operation system, so I made one.

*****************************

How to use it on Mac OS X?

*****************************

Installation is quite simple.  Click on you desktop (any free space), then use comand+shift+c combination (it opens your 'computer'). 

Then navigate to your hard drive (ex. Macintosh HD). Then go to the 'Library/Keyboard Layouts' directory. 

Now, simply drag and drop the .bundle file there. OS should ask for your password. You need to do this, because you are actually copy a file to your system. 

Now you can just reboot (or logout -> login). After reboot you should see your new, Silesian keyboard layout on Prefferences -> Language options.

If you need any help, feel free to contact me.
